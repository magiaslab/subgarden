    "philosophy_title": "The Empathetic Garden",
    "story_text": "In 1990, my journey into the plant world began almost in silence, driven by family necessity. But what was born as a duty turned, day after day, into an overwhelming passion. I fell in love with the purity of plants and their resilient ability to exist, simply, finding a deep sense of belonging in the earth.",

    "case_history_text": "One of my most significant projects was the recovery of the park of a villa from the 1700s in semi-abandonment. I listened to what the park wanted to become again, restoring historical symmetries and secular essences, transforming it into an excellent setting for VIP events and absolute relaxation, without ever breaking the dialogue with the surrounding landscape.",

    "innovation_text": "My passion for nature led me to create SUBGarden: a patented non-invasive sub-irrigation system. I protect the value of historical and modern gardens with a technology that is not seen, does not destroy the existing lawn during installation, and guarantees eternal beauty, supported by digital precision and absolute respect for the water resource.",
    "innovation_title": "The Invisible Sustainable Revolution",
    "philosophy_expanded_text1": "A garden doesn't end where the property line stops. My technique is inspired by the concept of 'Borrowed Scenery': freeing the gaze rather than delimiting it. I use natural wings and perspective telescopes to merge the private garden with the infinite horizon of Tuscany.",
    "philosophy_expanded_text2": "I define my approach as 'Empathetic Garden' because it resonates with the inhabitants and the place itself. I don't impose a form, but follow the voice of the earth, using the most advanced technology to serve the greatest simplicity.",
    "philosophy_expanded_title": "Borrowed Scenery and the Empathetic Garden",
    "roots_text": "In 1990 I wasn't looking for a career, but for answers. What started as support for the family business quickly became an intimate dialogue with the plant world. I was won over by the ability of plants to 'simply exist', their silent but invincible resilience. Since then, every garden I care for is a tribute to this strength.",
