    "story_text": "In 1990, Fausto Favilli's journey into the plant world began almost in silence, driven by family necessity. But what was born as a duty turned, day after day, into a revelation. Enamored by the purity of plants and their resilient ability to exist, simply, Fausto found a deep sense of belonging in the earth.",
    "philosophy_title": "The Empathetic Garden",
    "philosophy_text": "We don't just design spaces, we establish connections. Our goal is to accompany nature in its return to simplicity, so that those who live in the garden can perceive themselves as part of the surrounding horizon, with the emotional fantasy of the soul.",

    "roots_text": "In 1990 I wasn't looking for a career, but for answers. What started as support for the family business quickly became an intimate dialogue with the plant world. I was won over by the ability of plants to 'simply exist', their silent but invincible resilience. Since then, every garden we care for is a tribute to this strength.",
    "philosophy_expanded_title": "Borrowed Scenery and the Empathetic Garden",
    "philosophy_expanded_text1": "A garden doesn't end where the property line stops. Our technique is inspired by the concept of 'Borrowed Scenery': freeing the gaze rather than delimiting it. We use natural wings and perspective telescopes to merge the private garden with the infinite horizon of Tuscany.",
    "philosophy_expanded_text2": "We define our approach as 'Empathetic Garden' because it resonates with the inhabitants and the place itself. We don't impose a form, but follow the voice of the earth, using the most advanced technology to serve the greatest simplicity.",
    "case_history_title": "Restoration of the Soul: 18th Century Villa",
    "case_history_text": "One of our most significant projects was the recovery of the park of a villa from the 1700s in semi-abbandonment. We listened to what the park wanted to become again, restoring historical symmetries and secular essences, transforming it into an excellent setting for VIP events and absolute relaxation, without ever breaking the dialogue with the surrounding landscape.",
    "innovation_title": "The Invisible Sustainable Revolution",
    "innovation_text": "Our story of love for nature led us to create SUBGarden: a patented non-invasive sub-irrigation system. We protect the value of historical and modern gardens with a technology that is not seen, does not destroy the existing lawn during installation, and guarantees eternal beauty, supported by digital precision and absolute respect for the water resource."
